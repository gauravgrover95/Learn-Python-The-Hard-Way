#from this program we can start taking inputs

print "How old are you?",
age = raw_input()

print "How tall are you?",
height = raw_input()

print "How much do you weight?", 
weight = raw_input()

print "So, you are %r old ,%r tall and %r heavy." %(age, height, weight)

#this is the information gathered from tutorialspoint.com/python
print ""
print ""
str = raw_input("Enter your input here: ")
print "Received input is:", str

#So raw_input(); can also take up an argument and put it as a prompt
